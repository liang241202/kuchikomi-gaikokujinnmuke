# Dev Log – 2025-08-08

## ✅ What I did today
- Initialized the GitHub repository for "Foreigner Review Site" project
- Set up the full documentation structure (`docs/`, `feature-log/`, `dev-journal/`)
- Generated SSH keys and configured Git to use SSH (no more password/token needed!)
- Successfully pushed initial commit with documentation structure

## 🔧 Next step
- Move Spring Boot backend project into `backend/` folder
- Add and commit backend code to version control
- Start logging architectural decisions and individual features

## 📝 Notes

- Folder structure was clarified and verified
